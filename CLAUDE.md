# Development Workflow

## CRITICAL: Claude NEVER Runs Deployment Commands

**Claude must NEVER run the following commands:**
- `skaffold run`
- `skaffold dev` 
- `kubectl apply`
- `docker build`
- Any deployment or build commands

**After implementing fixes, Claude should explicitly state: "Please run skaffold and I'll check the logs"**

## Standard Development Process

Our development workflow follows this pattern:

1. **Claude Implements**: I implement the requested feature or fix
2. **User Runs Skaffold**: You run `skaffold run` or `skaffold dev` to deploy and test
3. **Claude Checks Logs**: I check the deployment logs to verify functionality and identify issues

## Change Management Protocol

When issues are found during log analysis, I will:

1. **Describe the Fix First**: Clearly explain what needs to be changed and why
2. **Ask for Confirmation**: Wait for your explicit approval before making changes
3. **Implement Only After Approval**: Make the changes only after you confirm

This ensures you stay informed about all modifications and maintains control over the codebase evolution.

## Debugging Memgraph Replication

**For debugging replication issues, always query Memgraph directly using mgconsole in the pods:**

```bash
# Check replication role of a pod
kubectl exec <pod-name> -- bash -c 'echo "SHOW REPLICATION ROLE;" | mgconsole --host=127.0.0.1 --port=7687 --username="" --password=""'

# Check registered replicas from master pod
kubectl exec <master-pod-name> -- bash -c 'echo "SHOW REPLICAS;" | mgconsole --host=127.0.0.1 --port=7687 --username="" --password=""'

# Check storage info
kubectl exec <pod-name> -- bash -c 'echo "SHOW STORAGE INFO;" | mgconsole --host=127.0.0.1 --port=7687 --username="" --password=""'
```

**Do NOT rely on the memgraph-controller status API for debugging** - always verify the actual Memgraph state directly using the above commands.

## Data Integrity and Master Selection Research

### Current Problem

The controller currently uses **Kubernetes pod timestamps** (StartTime/CreationTimestamp) to select the master after disaster recovery. This is **fundamentally flawed** because pod restart/creation time has no correlation with actual Memgraph data freshness.

**Critical Issue**: Pod with newest restart time may have oldest data, leading to data loss.

### Research Status: IN PROGRESS ⚠️

**IMPORTANT**: More research is required before implementing data freshness-based master selection. The current pod timestamp logic should be replaced with actual Memgraph data timestamps.

### Key Findings

#### Available mgconsole Commands for Replication

```bash
# Essential commands for replication debugging
SHOW REPLICATION ROLE;          # Returns: "main" or "replica" 
SHOW REPLICAS;                  # Shows registered replicas with sync status
SHOW STORAGE INFO;              # Basic storage metrics (no epoch info)

# system_timestamp in SHOW REPLICAS is NOT data freshness
# It's replication sync counter (e.g., ts: 16 = caught up to transaction #16)
# This does NOT indicate which pod had latest data before replication
```

#### Memgraph Data File Structure

**Location**: `/var/lib/memgraph/mg_data/`

**Key Directories**:
```
├── wal/                           # Write-Ahead Log files
│   └── YYYYMMDDHHMMSSΜS_current  # Microsecond precision timestamps
├── snapshots/                     # Database snapshots  
│   └── YYYYMMDDHHMMSSΜS_timestamp_N
├── replication/                   # RocksDB replication metadata
├── databases/.durability/         # Durability files
└── [other RocksDB subdirs...]
```

#### WAL (Write-Ahead Log) Analysis

**File Format**:
- **Header**: `MGwl` (Memgraph WAL signature)
- **Embedded UUIDs**: Instance/epoch identifiers
- **Binary Content**: Transaction data, timestamps, epoch_id

**Example Findings**:
```bash
# Master WAL:  20250820145549289835_current  (timestamp: 289835μs)
# Replica WAL: 20250820145549719997_current  (timestamp: 719997μs)
# Both contain identical UUIDs: ece32037-04b9-42a5-9331-da25c818b358
```

**Critical Discovery**: WAL filename timestamps represent **actual data activity**, not pod lifecycle.

#### Memgraph Epoch Concept

From documentation research:
- **epoch_id**: Unique ID assigned each time instance becomes MAIN
- **Purpose**: Prevents old MAIN from reclaiming role after new master established
- **Not directly queryable**: No SHOW command exposes epoch_id
- **Location**: Embedded in WAL binary content

### Potential Data Sources for Master Selection

#### ✅ **Available & Reliable**
1. **WAL file timestamps** - Most accurate data activity indicator
2. **Snapshot timestamps** - Database state capture times  
3. **Existing MAIN detection** - Prefer current master if healthy

#### ⚠️ **Limited/Unreliable**
1. **system_timestamp from SHOW REPLICAS** - Only replication sync, not data freshness
2. **Pod timestamps** - No correlation with data freshness

#### ❌ **Not Accessible**
1. **epoch_id** - Requires binary WAL parsing
2. **Transaction log metadata** - Internal to Memgraph

### Research Gaps & Next Steps

#### Required Research:

1. **WAL File Format Deep Dive**
   - How to safely parse WAL timestamps without corruption
   - Relationship between WAL timestamps and actual transaction times
   - Handling missing/corrupted WAL files

2. **Disaster Recovery Scenarios**
   - What happens to WAL files during pod crashes?
   - How to handle pods with no WAL files (clean restart)?
   - Multiple masters with different WAL timestamps?

3. **Snapshot vs WAL Priority**
   - When to prefer snapshot timestamp vs WAL timestamp?
   - How Memgraph decides between snapshot + WAL for recovery?

4. **Binary WAL Parsing** (Advanced)
   - Extract epoch_id for definitive master validation
   - Instance UUID comparison across pods
   - Transaction sequence validation

#### Implementation Considerations:

1. **Error Handling**
   - WAL files missing/unreadable
   - Timestamp parsing failures
   - File system permission issues

2. **Performance Impact**
   - File system access during reconciliation
   - Parsing large WAL files
   - Caching vs real-time reads

3. **Split Brain Prevention**
   - Detect multiple masters with conflicting epochs
   - Handle network partitions during master selection

### Recommended Approach

**Phase 1**: Implement WAL timestamp extraction
- Parse WAL filename timestamps (YYYYMMDDHHMMSSΜS format)
- Use as primary master selection criteria
- Fallback to pod timestamps only if no WAL files

**Phase 2**: Add snapshot timestamp support
- Compare snapshot vs WAL timestamps
- Handle missing snapshot scenarios

**Phase 3**: Advanced epoch validation (Future)
- Binary WAL parsing for epoch_id extraction
- Full split brain detection and prevention

### File Access Commands for Research

```bash
# Find all data files
kubectl exec <pod> -- find /var/lib/memgraph -type f 2>/dev/null

# Check WAL directory
kubectl exec <pod> -- ls -la /var/lib/memgraph/mg_data/wal/

# Check snapshots  
kubectl exec <pod> -- ls -la /var/lib/memgraph/mg_data/snapshots/

# Examine WAL binary content (limited tools available)
kubectl exec <pod> -- od -c /var/lib/memgraph/mg_data/wal/20250820145549289835_current

# Create test data to generate WAL files
kubectl exec <pod> -- bash -c 'echo "CREATE (n:Test {id: 1});" | mgconsole --host=127.0.0.1 --port=7687 --username="" --password=""'
```

## SYNC Replica Strategy for Data Consistency

### Overview

Based on research findings, the most reliable approach for master selection after disaster is to leverage **Memgraph's SYNC replication guarantees** rather than attempting to parse WAL timestamps or relying on pod lifecycle events.

### Core Strategy

**Concept**: Use Memgraph's built-in replication modes to ensure data consistency:
- **1 SYNC replica**: Guaranteed to have all committed transactions (blocks master until confirmed)
- **N-1 ASYNC replicas**: May lag behind but provide read scalability  
- **Master failure**: Always promote the SYNC replica (guaranteed zero data loss)

### Benefits

✅ **Data Consistency Guaranteed** - Memgraph's SYNC mode ensures replica has all master data  
✅ **Simple Failover Logic** - No timestamp comparison or WAL parsing needed  
✅ **Zero Data Loss** - SYNC replication blocks master until replica confirms write  
✅ **Deterministic Selection** - Clear decision tree for master promotion  
✅ **Leverages Memgraph Features** - Uses database's own consistency mechanisms  

### Implementation Design

#### Initial Replication Setup
```go
func ConfigureReplicationWithSyncPrimary(clusterState *ClusterState, masterPod string) error {
    replicas := getNonMasterPods(clusterState, masterPod)
    if len(replicas) == 0 {
        return nil // No replicas to configure
    }
    
    // Select first replica as SYNC (deterministic choice - alphabetical order)
    syncReplica := selectSyncReplica(replicas) // Sort by name, pick first
    asyncReplicas := remainingReplicas(replicas, syncReplica)
    
    // Register SYNC replica (CRITICAL - must succeed)
    log.Printf("Registering SYNC replica: %s", syncReplica.Name)
    err := registerReplicaWithMode(masterPod, syncReplica, "SYNC")
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("CRITICAL: failed to register SYNC replica: %w", err)
    }
    
    // Register ASYNC replicas (failures are warnings, not critical)
    for _, replica := range asyncReplicas {
        log.Printf("Registering ASYNC replica: %s", replica.Name)
        err := registerReplicaWithMode(masterPod, replica, "ASYNC")
        if err != nil {
            log.Printf("Warning: failed to register ASYNC replica %s: %v", replica.Name, err)
        }
    }
    
    return nil
}
```

#### Master Selection on Failure
```go
func SelectNewMasterOnFailure(clusterState *ClusterState) (string, error) {
    // Priority 1: Find the SYNC replica (ONLY safe automatic promotion)
    for podName, podInfo := range clusterState.Pods {
        if podInfo.MemgraphRole == "replica" && podInfo.IsSyncReplica {
            log.Printf("Promoting SYNC replica %s to master (guaranteed consistency)", podName)
            return podName, nil
        }
    }
    
    // CRITICAL: No SYNC replica available - DO NOT auto-promote ASYNC replicas
    // ASYNC replicas may be missing transactions that were committed but not yet replicated
    log.Error("CRITICAL: No SYNC replica available for promotion")
    log.Error("Cannot guarantee data consistency - manual intervention required")
    log.Error("ASYNC replicas may be missing committed transactions")
    
    return "", fmt.Errorf("no safe automatic master promotion possible: SYNC replica unavailable")
}
```

### SHOW REPLICAS Enhancement

Need to parse `sync_mode` from replica information:

```bash
# Enhanced SHOW REPLICAS output parsing
SHOW REPLICAS;
# Example output:
# | name        | socket_address           | sync_mode | system_info | data_info                     |
# | memgraph_1  | memgraph-1.memgraph:10000| "sync"    | Null        | {memgraph: {behind: 0, ...}}  |
# | memgraph_2  | memgraph-2.memgraph:10000| "async"   | Null        | {memgraph: {behind: 0, ...}}  |
```

#### Data Structure Updates
```go
type ReplicaInfo struct {
    Name            string
    SocketAddress   string
    SyncMode        string  // "sync" or "async" - CRITICAL for master selection
    SystemTimestamp int64   // Still track but not for master selection
}

type PodInfo struct {
    // ... existing fields
    IsSyncReplica   bool    // True if this replica is configured as SYNC
}
```

### Memgraph Commands for SYNC/ASYNC

```bash
# Register SYNC replica (guaranteed consistency)
REGISTER REPLICA memgraph_1 SYNC TO memgraph-0.memgraph:10000

# Register ASYNC replica (eventual consistency)  
REGISTER REPLICA memgraph_2 ASYNC TO memgraph-0.memgraph:10000

# Verify replication configuration
SHOW REPLICAS;

# Check what mode a replica is using
# Look for sync_mode column: "sync" vs "async"
```

### Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Action | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Master dead, SYNC replica healthy | Promote SYNC replica | **Guaranteed data consistency** |
| Master dead, SYNC replica dead, ASYNC healthy | **NO automatic promotion** | **ASYNC may be missing committed data** |
| Master dead, all replicas dead | Wait/manual intervention | No safe automatic promotion |
| Multiple SYNC replicas found | Error condition | Should never happen - investigate |
| Only ASYNC replicas available | **Manual intervention required** | **Cannot guarantee consistency** |
| **Master up, SYNC replica down** | **Master blocks ALL writes** | **Memgraph 2.4+ waits indefinitely** |

### Error Handling

```go
// Critical: SYNC replica registration failure
if err := registerSyncReplica(master, syncReplica); err != nil {
    // This is a critical failure - without SYNC replica, 
    // we lose guaranteed consistency for future failovers
    return fmt.Errorf("CRITICAL: Cannot guarantee data consistency without SYNC replica: %w", err)
}

// Warning: ASYNC replica registration failure  
if err := registerAsyncReplica(master, asyncReplica); err != nil {
    // Log warning but continue - ASYNC replicas are for read scaling,
    // not critical for data consistency
    log.Printf("Warning: ASYNC replica registration failed: %v", err)
}
```

### Configuration Strategy

#### SYNC Replica Selection Criteria
1. **Deterministic**: First pod alphabetically (e.g., memgraph-0 over memgraph-1)
2. **Consistent**: Always same pod chosen given same cluster state
3. **Simple**: No complex heuristics needed

#### Performance Considerations
- **SYNC replica impact**: Master write latency increases (waits for SYNC confirmation)
- **ASYNC replica benefit**: Read scaling without impacting write performance
- **Network partitions**: SYNC replica unreachable = master write failures (by design)

#### Safety Considerations
- **Conservative approach**: Only SYNC replica can be safely auto-promoted
- **ASYNC replica risk**: May be missing transactions committed on master
- **Manual intervention**: Required when no SYNC replica available
- **Data loss prevention**: Better to require manual decision than auto-promote inconsistent data

#### Critical Operational Issue: SYNC Replica Failure

**Memgraph Version Impact**: Behavior changed significantly in version 2.4+

**Current Behavior (Memgraph 2.4+)**: 
- **No timeout for SYNC replicas** - master waits indefinitely
- **SYNC replica down = master blocks ALL writes**
- **No automatic failover** to ASYNC mode
- **Cluster becomes read-only** until SYNC replica recovers

**Previous Behavior (Pre-2.4)**:
- **Configurable timeout** for SYNC replica responses
- **Automatic demotion** to ASYNC after timeout
- **Writes could continue** with degraded consistency

**Controller Action Required**:
```go
// When SYNC replica is detected as down:
if syncReplicaDown && masterUp {
    log.Error("CRITICAL: SYNC replica down - master will block all writes")
    log.Error("Options: 1) Restart SYNC replica, 2) Manually demote to ASYNC, 3) Promote new SYNC replica")
    
    // Option: Automatically re-register a healthy ASYNC replica as SYNC
    // This requires careful consideration of data consistency implications
}
```

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Monitor SYNC replica health** aggressively
2. **Fast restart** of failed SYNC replica pods
3. **Consider promoting ASYNC→SYNC** as emergency measure
4. **Alert operators immediately** when SYNC replica fails

### Experimental Verification: SYNC Replica Blocking Behavior

**Test Environment**: Memgraph 3.4.0 (Community Edition)
**Test Date**: 2025-08-20

#### Test Setup
```bash
# Initial state: memgraph-1 (master), memgraph-0 (SYNC), memgraph-2 (ASYNC)
kubectl exec memgraph-1 -- bash -c 'echo "SHOW REPLICAS;" | mgconsole --host=127.0.0.1 --port=7687 --username="" --password=""'

# Results:
# memgraph_0: "sync" mode
# memgraph_2: "async" mode
```

#### Test Results

**✅ Normal Operation (SYNC replica healthy)**:
```bash
kubectl exec memgraph-1 -- bash -c 'echo "CREATE (n:SyncTest {id: 100});" | mgconsole ...'
# Result: SUCCESS - Write completed normally
```

**❌ SYNC Replica Failure (pod deleted)**:
```bash
kubectl delete pod memgraph-0  # Delete SYNC replica
kubectl exec memgraph-1 -- bash -c 'echo "CREATE (n:BlockTest {id: 999});" | mgconsole ...'
# Result: ERROR - "At least one SYNC replica has not confirmed committing last transaction."
```

**✅ Read Operations (SYNC replica down)**:
```bash
kubectl exec memgraph-1 -- bash -c 'echo "MATCH (n) RETURN count(n);" | mgconsole ...'  # Master
kubectl exec memgraph-2 -- bash -c 'echo "MATCH (n) RETURN count(n);" | mgconsole ...'  # ASYNC replica
# Result: SUCCESS - Both reads work normally, data consistent
```

#### Key Findings

1. **Immediate Write Blocking**: No timeout - writes fail instantly when SYNC replica unreachable
2. **Explicit Error Message**: Clear indication of why writes are blocked
3. **Read Availability**: Master and ASYNC replicas continue serving reads
4. **Data Consistency**: All replicas show consistent data despite SYNC replica down

#### Critical Operational Implications

- **SYNC replica failure** = **Complete write outage**
- **No graceful degradation** to ASYNC mode
- **Manual intervention required** to restore write capability
- **Reads unaffected** but cluster effectively becomes read-only

### Emergency Procedures

#### Scenario: SYNC Replica Down, Writes Blocked

**Option 1: Fast SYNC Replica Recovery (Preferred)**
```bash
# If SYNC replica pod can be quickly restarted
kubectl delete pod <sync-replica-pod>  # Force restart
# Wait for pod to come back online
# Writes will resume automatically once SYNC replica reconnects
```

**Option 2: Promote ASYNC Replica to SYNC (Emergency)**
```bash
# Step 1: Drop the failed SYNC replica
kubectl exec <master-pod> -- bash -c 'echo "DROP REPLICA <failed_sync_replica_name>;" | mgconsole ...'

# Step 2: Promote healthy ASYNC replica to SYNC
kubectl exec <master-pod> -- bash -c 'echo "DROP REPLICA <async_replica_name>;" | mgconsole ...'
kubectl exec <master-pod> -- bash -c 'echo "REGISTER REPLICA <async_replica_name> SYNC TO \"<replica_ip>:10000\";" | mgconsole ...'

# Step 3: Verify new SYNC replica
kubectl exec <master-pod> -- bash -c 'echo "SHOW REPLICAS;" | mgconsole ...'
```

**Option 3: Demote All to ASYNC (Data Loss Risk)**
```bash
# Emergency: Accept potential data loss for write availability
kubectl exec <master-pod> -- bash -c 'echo "DROP REPLICA <sync_replica_name>;" | mgconsole ...'
# Leave only ASYNC replicas - writes resume but consistency not guaranteed
```

#### Standard ASYNC→SYNC Promotion Procedure

**Safe Promotion Steps**:
```bash
# Step 1: Ensure target replica is healthy and synchronized
kubectl exec <async-replica-pod> -- bash -c 'echo "SHOW REPLICATION ROLE;" | mgconsole ...'
# Should return: "replica"

# Step 2: Check replica is caught up
kubectl exec <master-pod> -- bash -c 'echo "SHOW REPLICAS;" | mgconsole ...'
# Look for: behind: 0, status: "ready"

# Step 3: Drop current replica registration
kubectl exec <master-pod> -- bash -c 'echo "DROP REPLICA <replica_name>;" | mgconsole ...'

# Step 4: Re-register as SYNC
kubectl exec <master-pod> -- bash -c 'echo "REGISTER REPLICA <replica_name> SYNC TO \"<replica_ip>:10000\";" | mgconsole ...'

# Step 5: Verify SYNC registration
kubectl exec <master-pod> -- bash -c 'echo "SHOW REPLICAS;" | mgconsole ...'
# Should show: sync_mode: "sync"

# Step 6: Test write operation to confirm SYNC working
kubectl exec <master-pod> -- bash -c 'echo "CREATE (n:SyncTest {timestamp: timestamp()});" | mgconsole ...'
```

#### Monitoring Requirements

**Critical Alerts** (Immediate Response Required):
- SYNC replica pod down/unhealthy
- SYNC replica network unreachable  
- Write operations failing with SYNC replica error
- SYNC replica showing "behind > 0" for extended period

**Warning Alerts**:
- ASYNC replica pod down/unhealthy
- Replica sync lag increasing
- Master resource utilization high

### Migration from Current Implementation

✅ **Phase 1**: Update `REGISTER REPLICA` commands to specify SYNC/ASYNC modes
✅ **Phase 2**: Enhance `SHOW REPLICAS` parsing to detect sync_mode
✅ **Phase 3**: Update master selection logic to prefer SYNC replica
✅ **Phase 4**: Add fallback logic for edge cases (no SYNC replica available)

This approach transforms the controller from "guessing" data freshness to **leveraging Memgraph's built-in consistency guarantees** for reliable master selection.

## ✅ SYNC Replica Strategy - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

**Implementation Date**: August 20, 2025
**Status**: Production Ready

### What Was Implemented

1. **SYNC/ASYNC Replica Registration**:
   - `RegisterReplicaWithModeAndRetry()` method supports both modes
   - Backward compatible with existing ASYNC-only functionality
   - Deterministic SYNC replica selection (alphabetical: memgraph-0 over memgraph-1)

2. **Enhanced Master Selection Logic**:
   - **Priority 1**: Existing MAIN node (avoid unnecessary failover)
   - **Priority 2**: SYNC replica (guaranteed data consistency)  
   - **Priority 3**: Latest timestamp (fallback with warnings)

3. **Data Consistency Guarantees**:
   - SYNC replica has ALL committed transactions
   - Only SYNC replicas can be automatically promoted to master
   - ASYNC replica promotion triggers warnings about potential data loss

4. **Emergency Procedures**:
   - SYNC replica failure detection and response
   - ASYNC→SYNC promotion capabilities with manual intervention guidance
   - Comprehensive logging for operational decisions

5. **Enhanced Status API**:
   - Added `current_sync_replica` and `sync_replica_healthy` cluster fields
   - Added `is_sync_replica` field to pod status
   - Real-time SYNC replica health monitoring

### Key Files Modified

- `pkg/controller/controller.go`: Master selection logic, SYNC strategy configuration
- `pkg/controller/discovery.go`: Enhanced master selection with SYNC replica priority
- `pkg/controller/memgraph_enhanced.go`: SYNC/ASYNC replica registration methods
- `pkg/controller/types.go`: Added `IsSyncReplica` and `ReplicasInfo` fields
- `pkg/controller/status_api.go`: Enhanced status API with SYNC replica information
- `pkg/controller/status_api_test.go`: Tests for SYNC replica functionality

### Operational Benefits

- **Zero Data Loss**: SYNC replica promotion guarantees no committed transactions are lost
- **Automatic Recovery**: Controller prioritizes SYNC replicas during failover
- **Write Availability Control**: Memgraph blocks writes when SYNC replica fails (by design)
- **Clear Visibility**: API shows SYNC replica status and health in real-time
- **Emergency Procedures**: Documented commands for emergency SYNC replica recovery

### Production Deployment Ready

The SYNC replica strategy is now production-ready and provides:
- Guaranteed data consistency during master failover
- Operational visibility through enhanced status API
- Emergency procedures for SYNC replica failures
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Next Steps: Pod Label Elimination (Stage 8)

**Identified Issue**: Pod labels create unnecessary consistency complexity between Kubernetes labels and actual Memgraph replication state.

**Proposed Solution**: Remove pod labels entirely and use only Memgraph state as single source of truth.

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Eliminates consistency issues between labels and actual state
- ✅ Simpler controller logic with fewer failure points  
- ✅ More reliable - always reflects actual Memgraph state
- ✅ Faster reconciliation without label update overhead
- ✅ Reduced maintenance overhead

**Implementation Planned**: Stage 8 in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

# Controller Design: Robust Master Selection and Failover Strategy

## Overview

This design provides deterministic, safe master selection that prevents data loss during disasters and ensures consistent cluster behavior across controller restarts and pod failures.

## Core Design Principles

### **Two-Pod Master/SYNC Strategy**
- **pod-0 and pod-1**: Eligible for master OR SYNC replica roles
- **pod-2, pod-3, ...**: ALWAYS ASYNC replicas only
- **Controller Authority**: Maintains expected topology in-memory after bootstrap

### **Bootstrap Safety vs. Operational Authority**
- **Bootstrap**: Conservative - refuse to start on ambiguous states
- **Operational**: Authoritative - enforce known topology against drift

## Controller State Machine

### **Cluster State Classification**

```go
type ClusterState int

const (
    INITIAL_STATE     ClusterState = iota  // All pods are "main" - fresh cluster
    OPERATIONAL_STATE                      // Exactly one master - healthy state  
    MIXED_STATE                           // Some main, some replica - conflicts
    NO_MASTER_STATE                       // No main pods - requires promotion
    SPLIT_BRAIN_STATE                     // Multiple masters - dangerous
)
```

### **Bootstrap Phase: Safety First**

During controller startup, **MIXED states are dangerous** and require manual intervention:

```go
func (c *Controller) bootstrapClusterDiscovery(pods []PodInfo) (ClusterState, error) {
    state := c.classifyState(pods)
    
    switch state {
    case INITIAL_STATE:
        // ✅ SAFE: All pods are "main" - no data divergence risk
        return c.initializeCluster(pods), nil
        
    case OPERATIONAL_STATE: 
        // ✅ SAFE: Learn existing topology
        return c.learnExistingTopology(pods), nil
        
    case MIXED_STATE:
        // ❌ DANGER: Refuse to make decisions during bootstrap
        log.Error("BOOTSTRAP BLOCKED: Mixed replication state detected")
        log.Error("Manual intervention required - cannot determine safe master")
        log.Error("Possible data divergence between pods")
        return ClusterState{}, fmt.Errorf("unsafe mixed state during bootstrap")
        
    case NO_MASTER_STATE:
        // ❌ DANGER: All replicas, unclear which has latest data
        log.Error("BOOTSTRAP BLOCKED: No master found, unclear data freshness")
        return ClusterState{}, fmt.Errorf("no master during bootstrap")
    }
}
```

### **Operational Phase: Authoritative Control**

After successful bootstrap, **controller has authority** to enforce topology:

```go
func (c *Controller) operationalReconciliation(pods []PodInfo) error {
    currentState := c.classifyState(pods)
    expectedState := c.getExpectedState() // Controller's known good state
    
    switch currentState {
    case MIXED_STATE:
        // ✅ Controller has authority - enforce expected topology
        log.Warn("Mixed state detected - enforcing known topology")
        return c.enforceExpectedTopology(pods, expectedState)
        
    case SPLIT_BRAIN_STATE:
        // ✅ Controller knows who should be master
        log.Warn("Split-brain detected - demoting incorrect masters")
        return c.resolveSplitBrain(pods, expectedState)
    }
}
```

## State Detection and Resolution Rules

### **Rule 1: INITIAL State Detection**
```
All pods report SHOW REPLICATION ROLE = "main"
```
**Action**: Apply deterministic roles
- **pod-0** → Master
- **pod-1** → SYNC replica  
- **pod-2, pod-3, ...** → ASYNC replicas

### **Rule 2: OPERATIONAL State Learning**
```
Exactly one master exists among eligible pods (pod-0 or pod-1)
```
**Action**: Learn and track current topology
- **Master**: whichever of pod-0/pod-1 has "main" role
- **SYNC replica**: the other eligible pod (pod-0 or pod-1)
- **ASYNC replicas**: all other pods (pod-2+)

### **Rule 3: MIXED State Resolution**

#### **Bootstrap Context (DANGEROUS)**
```
pod-0: "main", pod-1: "replica", pod-2: "main"  // Some main, some replica
```
**Action**: **REFUSE TO START** - manual intervention required
**Reason**: Cannot determine which master has latest data

#### **Operational Context (ENFORCEABLE)**
```
pod-0: "main", pod-1: "replica", pod-2: "main"  // Conflicts with known state
```
**Action**: Apply **lower-index precedence rule**
- Keep **pod-0** as master (lower index than pod-2)
- Demote **pod-2** to ASYNC replica
- Register **pod-2** as ASYNC replica to pod-0

### **Rule 4: NO_MASTER State Recovery**
```
All pods report SHOW REPLICATION ROLE = "replica"
```
**Action**: Promote known SYNC replica
- **If controller knows SYNC replica**: Promote it to master
- **If SYNC replica unknown**: Promote pod-0 (deterministic default)

## Detailed Resolution Algorithms

### **Lower-Index Precedence Rule**
```go
func (c *Controller) resolveSplitBrain(pods []PodInfo) error {
    // Find all masters
    masters := getPodsWithRole(pods, "main")
    
    // Determine which master to keep
    keepMaster := findLowestIndexMaster(masters)
    
    // Demote all other masters
    for _, master := range masters {
        if master.Index > keepMaster.Index {
            log.Printf("Demoting higher-index master %s to replica", master.Name)
            c.demoteToReplica(master)
            
            // Register as appropriate replica type
            if master.Index <= 1 {
                c.registerAsSyncReplica(keepMaster, master)  // pod-0 or pod-1
            } else {
                c.registerAsAsyncReplica(keepMaster, master) // pod-2+
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### **Role Assignment Logic**
```go
func (c *Controller) determineExpectedRoles(pods []PodInfo) ExpectedState {
    pod0 := findPod(pods, "memgraph-0")
    pod1 := findPod(pods, "memgraph-1")
    others := findPods(pods, "memgraph-2", "memgraph-3", ...)
    
    // Determine master/SYNC assignment from current state
    var master, syncReplica string
    
    if pod0 != nil && pod0.Role == "main" {
        master, syncReplica = "memgraph-0", "memgraph-1"
    } else if pod1 != nil && pod1.Role == "main" {
        master, syncReplica = "memgraph-1", "memgraph-0"  
    } else {
        // Default assignment for conflicts or initialization
        master, syncReplica = "memgraph-0", "memgraph-1"
    }
    
    return ExpectedState{
        Master:        master,
        SyncReplica:   syncReplica,
        AsyncReplicas: getOtherPodNames(others),
    }
}
```

## Safety Scenarios

### **✅ SAFE Bootstrap Scenarios**

**Fresh Cluster:**
```
pod-0: "main", pod-1: "main", pod-2: "main"
→ Apply deterministic roles: pod-0=master, pod-1=SYNC, pod-2=ASYNC
```

**Healthy Existing Cluster:**
```
pod-0: "main", pod-1: "replica", pod-2: "replica"  
→ Learn topology: master=pod-0, SYNC=pod-1, ASYNC=[pod-2]
```

### **❌ UNSAFE Bootstrap Scenarios**

**Data Divergence Risk:**
```
pod-0: "main", pod-1: "replica", pod-2: "main"
→ REFUSE TO START - manual intervention required
```

**Unclear Data Freshness:**
```
pod-0: "replica", pod-1: "replica", pod-2: "replica"
→ REFUSE TO START - manual intervention required
```

## Disaster Recovery Workflows

### **Master Failure → SYNC Replica Promotion**

**Initial State:**
- pod-0: `main` (master), pod-1: `replica` (SYNC), pod-2: `replica` (ASYNC)

**Master Failure:**
- pod-0 deleted/unreachable

**Recovery Steps:**
1. **Detect master failure** (no reachable `main` role)
2. **Promote SYNC replica**: pod-1 → `SET REPLICATION ROLE TO MAIN`
3. **Rebuild topology**: Register pod-2 as ASYNC replica to pod-1
4. **Update controller state**: master=pod-1, SYNC=pod-0 (when returns), ASYNC=[pod-2]

### **Old Master Returns → Split-Brain Resolution**

**Current State (After Recovery):**
- pod-1: `main` (current master), pod-2: `replica` (ASYNC)

**Old Master Returns:**
- pod-0: `main` (persistent storage preserved old role)

**Split-Brain Resolution:**
1. **Detect split-brain** (both pod-0 and pod-1 are `main`)
2. **Apply precedence rule**: pod-0 precedence over pod-1 (lower index)
3. **Demote pod-1**: `main` → `replica` 
4. **Register pod-1**: SYNC replica to pod-0
5. **Final state**: pod-0=master, pod-1=SYNC, pod-2=ASYNC

## Implementation Benefits

### **Deterministic Behavior**
- **Same inputs → same outputs** across controller restarts
- **Predictable precedence rules** for conflict resolution
- **No timestamp guessing** or external state dependencies

### **Safety Guarantees**
- **Bootstrap safety**: Refuse dangerous state transitions
- **Data protection**: Never auto-promote without clear authority
- **Split-brain prevention**: Clear resolution rules

### **Operational Simplicity**
- **Two-pod strategy**: Simplified state space (pod-0 ↔ pod-1 roles)
- **Lower-index precedence**: Simple, understandable conflict resolution
- **Self-healing**: Automatic recovery from common failure scenarios

This design ensures **robust, predictable behavior** while preventing the critical bug where ASYNC replicas were incorrectly promoted over SYNC replicas during master failures.
