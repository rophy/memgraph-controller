# Data Divergence Issue - Test Run 6 Failure Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Test Run**: 6 of 99
**Status**: FAILED - Permanent data divergence detected
**Result**: 5 PASSED, 1 FAILED

## Executive Summary

Test run 6 failed with "Cluster failed to converge within 180s" after rolling restart. Root cause analysis reveals **permanent data divergence** where pod-2 recovered from an old snapshot at timestamp **915** while the current main (pod-1) had progressed to timestamp **1223**. This created a 308-transaction gap that Memgraph correctly refused to accept, leaving the cluster in an unrecoverable state.

## Critical Finding

**Pod-2 recovered from snapshot created at 14:59:35 (timestamp 915) during its second recreation at 15:03:18**, even though the main pod had already progressed to timestamp 1223. This created divergence when pod-1 tried to register pod-2 as a replica.

### The Divergence Numbers
- **Snapshot timestamp**: **915** (created at 14:59:35)
- **Main pod timestamp when pod-2 recovered**: **1223**
- **Divergence gap**: 308 transactions
- **Behind value**: -308 (negative because pod-2 is "ahead" in its own timeline but "diverged" from main)

## Detailed Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Failover (15:02:02)
**Pod-1 (previous main) marked for deletion, failover to pod-0**

| Time | Event | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| 15:02:02.361 | Pod-1 became unhealthy | deletionTimestamp set, ready=false |
| 15:02:02.362 | Failover check initiated | Main pod unhealthy, checking replicas |
| 15:02:02.370 | Replicas ready | pod-0 ready, pod-2 ready (both at ts=1133) |
| 15:02:02.505 | **FAILOVER #1 COMPLETED** | target_main_index: 1 ‚Üí 0 (pod-1 ‚Üí pod-0) |
| 15:02:02.539 | PreStop hook started | pod_name=memgraph-ha-1 |
| 15:02:04.541 | PreStop completed | Cluster healthy |
| 15:02:06.964 | Pod-1 deleted | Old pod removed |
| 15:02:06.984 | Pod-1 recreated | phase=Pending |
| 15:02:10.061 | Pod-1 started | phase=Running |
| 15:02:13.642 | Pod-1 demoted | Successfully demoted to replica |

**Status**: ‚úÖ Clean failover from pod-1 to pod-0

---

### Phase 2: Pod-2 First Deletion (15:02:26 - 15:02:31)
**First rolling restart deletion of pod-2**

| Time | Event | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| 15:02:26.233 | PreStop hook started | pod_name=memgraph-ha-2 |
| 15:02:28.234 | PreStop completed | Cluster healthy, pod-2 at ts=1175 |
| 15:02:30.618 | Pod-2 deleted | Old pod removed |
| 15:02:31 (approx) | Pod-2 recreated | New pod started (not in logs) |
| 15:02:34.796 | Pod-2 status: invalid | ts=1175, behind=0 |
| 15:02:37.070 | Pod-2 status: invalid | ts=1175, behind=-7 (main progressing) |
| 15:02:46.948 | Pod-2 recovered | status=ready, **ts=1182** |

**Status**: ‚úÖ Pod-2 successfully recovered to ts=1182

---

### Phase 3: Pod-1 PreStop Hook Wait (15:02:37 - 15:02:47)
**Pod-1 deletion triggered, PreStop hook waits for pod-2**

| Time | Event | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| 15:02:37.286 | PreStop hook started | pod_name=memgraph-ha-1 |
| 15:02:39.287 | PreStop waiting | pod-2 status=invalid, behind=-7, ts=1175 |
| 15:02:41.287 | PreStop waiting | pod-2 still invalid |
| 15:02:43.287 | PreStop waiting | pod-2 still invalid |
| 15:02:45.287 | PreStop waiting | pod-2 still invalid |
| 15:02:47.287 | **PreStop completed** | Cluster healthy, pod-2 recovered to ready |

**PreStop Hook Behavior**: Correctly waited 10 seconds for pod-2 to recover from invalid to ready before allowing pod-1 deletion.

---

### Phase 4: Pod-2 Second Deletion (15:03:11 - 15:03:18)
**Second rolling restart deletion of pod-2 - DIVERGENCE BEGINS**

| Time | Event | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| 15:03:11.313 | PreStop hook started | pod_name=memgraph-ha-2 |
| 15:03:13.314 | PreStop completed | Cluster healthy, pod-2 at **ts=1216** |
| 15:03:15.822 | **Pod-2 deleted** | Old pod removed |
| 15:03:18.427 | üö® **POD-2 RECOVERY** | Recovered from **snapshot timestamp 915** |
| 15:03:18.427 | Snapshot file | `/var/lib/memgraph/mg_data/snapshots/20251020145935498708_timestamp_915` |
| 15:03:19.847 | Pod-2 status: invalid | ts=1216, behind=0 (brief moment) |
| 15:03:22.287 | Pod-2 status: invalid | ts=1216, behind=-7 |
| 15:03:46.948 | üö® **DIVERGENCE DETECTED** | ts=**915**, behind=-308, status=**diverged** |

**Critical Gap**: Between 15:03:22 (ts=1216, invalid) and 15:03:46 (ts=915, diverged), pod-2's timestamp **dropped from 1216 to 915**!

---

### Phase 5: Second Failover (15:02:55 - 15:02:58)
**Pod-0 marked for deletion during pod-2's second deletion**

| Time | Event | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| 15:02:55.572 | Pod-0 became unhealthy | Main pod marked for deletion |
| 15:02:55.748 | PreStop hook started | pod_name=memgraph-ha-0 |
| 15:02:55.819 | Failover attempt BLOCKED | pod-1 status=invalid (ts=1187) |
| 15:02:57.748 | PreStop completed | Cluster healthy after 2 seconds |
| 15:02:58.867 | Replicas ready | Both pod-1 and pod-2 ready |
| 15:02:58.972 | **FAILOVER #2 COMPLETED** | target_main_index: 0 ‚Üí 1 (pod-0 ‚Üí pod-1) |
| 15:03:06.081 | Pod-0 demoted | Successfully demoted to replica |

**Status**: ‚úÖ Clean failover from pod-0 to pod-1

---

### Phase 6: Stuck State & Test Failure (15:03:46 - 15:07:09+)
**Cluster unable to recover, test times out**

| Time | Event | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 15:03:46.948 | **Pod-2 diverged** | ts=915, behind=-308, main at ts=1223 |
| 15:03:49.709 | Failover attempt BLOCKED | "replica not ready (status: diverged)" |
| 15:03:55-04:08 | Multiple failover attempts | All BLOCKED due to diverged pod-2 |
| 15:04:00 - 15:07:00 | Cluster stuck | Behind value grows: -308 ‚Üí -884 |
| 15:07:09 | **TEST TIMEOUT** | E2ETestError: Cluster failed to converge within 180s |
| Hours later | **STILL DIVERGED** | No automatic recovery possible |

**Memgraph Replication Status at Failure**:
```
Main: memgraph-ha-1 (ts=1874)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ memgraph_ha_0 (strict_sync): behind=0, status=ready ‚úÖ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ memgraph_ha_2 (async): behind=-959, status=diverged ‚ùå
```

**Controller Logs**:
```

```

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Critical Question
**Why did pod-2 recover from snapshot at timestamp 915 when it was deleted at timestamp 1216?**

### Timeline of Divergence Creation

1. **14:59:35** - Memgraph created snapshot at timestamp 915 (periodic snapshot every 5 minutes)
2. **15:02:26 - 15:03:13** - Pod-2 progressed from ts=1175 ‚Üí ts=1216 through normal replication
3. **15:03:13** - Pod-2 PreStop hook completed, cluster healthy at ts=1216
4. **15:03:15** - Pod-2 deleted
5. **15:03:18** - üö® **Pod-2 recovered from OLD snapshot at ts=915** (NOT ts=1216!)
6. **15:03:22** - Main pod already at ts=1223 (7 transactions ahead of pod-2's pre-deletion state)
7. **15:03:46** - Controller detected divergence: pod-2 at ts=915, main at ts=1223

### Why snapshot-on-exit Didn't Work

According to commit `aebffb8`, `--storage-snapshot-on-exit=true` was enabled to ensure pods create snapshots before termination. However, **pod-2 did NOT create a snapshot at ts=1216 before termination**.

**Evidence**: Pod-2 recovered from snapshot `20251020145935498708_timestamp_915` created at **14:59:35**, not from a recent snapshot at ts=1216.

**Possible explanations**:
1. **Snapshot-on-exit not triggered**: Pod might have been force-killed or snapshot creation failed
2. **Snapshot creation takes time**: Pod terminated before snapshot-on-exit could complete
3. **WAL files diverged**: Even with snapshot-on-exit, WAL files from old timeline used during recovery
4. **Init container issue**: Data cleanup init container might have interfered with snapshot recovery

---

## What Went Wrong

### Controller Behavior: ‚úÖ MOSTLY CORRECT
1. ‚úÖ PreStop hooks executed correctly and waited for replicas to recover
2. ‚úÖ Failovers completed cleanly when replicas were ready
3. ‚úÖ Divergence detected correctly
4. ‚úÖ Unsafe failover attempts blocked
5. ‚ùå **NO automatic recovery mechanism** - just logged and waited indefinitely

### Memgraph Behavior: ‚úÖ CORRECT
1. ‚úÖ Recovered from available snapshot (timestamp 915)
2. ‚úÖ Detected UUID/data divergence
3. ‚úÖ Refused to register diverged replica
4. ‚úÖ Protected data integrity

### The Gap: ‚ö†Ô∏è SNAPSHOT RECOVERY ISSUE
**The issue is in the snapshot/WAL recovery mechanism:**
- Pod-2 should have created a snapshot at ts=1216 before termination (snapshot-on-exit)
- Instead, it recovered from an old snapshot at ts=915 (created 3+ minutes earlier)
- This created a 301-transaction gap (1216 - 915 = 301)
- Combined with main's continued writes (+7 transactions), total divergence = 308 transactions

---

## Rule Violations

### Rule 1: Writing data to two different main nodes
**Status**: ‚úÖ NOT VIOLATED
- Only one main at a time during pod-2's recreation
- Dual-main situations were temporary (during failover) and correctly resolved
- No concurrent writes to multiple mains

### Rule 2: Two main nodes registering replication to the same replica
**Status**: ‚úÖ NOT VIOLATED
- Controller correctly blocked all attempts to register pod-2 while diverged
- No replica received replication from multiple mains

**Root Cause**: NOT a rule violation, but **snapshot recovery from stale data** causing temporal divergence

---

## Impact Assessment

### Test Results
- **5 consecutive successful runs** before failure
- **First failure at run 6** (83% success rate in first 6 runs)
- **Permanent divergence** - no automatic recovery after test timeout

### Recovery Requirement
**Manual intervention required:**
1. Delete diverged pod (pod-2)
2. Clear PVC or trigger hard reset mechanism
3. Allow pod to restart fresh and resync from current main
4. OR use the hard reset mechanism (implemented in commit `9130a72` but not automatically triggered)

### Failure Mode
This is a **catastrophic failure mode** for production:
- Cluster becomes stuck and unable to accept async replica
- Data loss risk: pod-2's timestamp 916-1216 data will be lost (if any writes occurred)
- Requires manual intervention or automatic hard reset
- Test cannot progress until cluster converges

---

## Questions for Further Investigation

### Critical Question: Why didn't snapshot-on-exit create a snapshot at ts=1216?

**Hypothesis 1: Snapshot Creation Not Completed**
- Pod terminated before snapshot-on-exit could complete
- Snapshot creation takes time, Kubernetes killed pod too fast
- Need to verify: Does preStop hook give enough time for snapshot creation?

**Hypothesis 2: Snapshot File Issue**
- Snapshot was created but not persisted to PVC
- File system sync issue
- Permissions or disk space issue

**Hypothesis 3: WAL Recovery Logic**
- Even with snapshot-on-exit, WAL files from old timeline were used
- Memgraph recovery logic prioritized old snapshot over recent WAL
- Need to verify: How does Memgraph choose between snapshots and WAL during recovery?

### Investigation Needed

1. **Check pod-2 logs during first deletion (15:02:30)** - Was snapshot created?
2. **Check pod-2 logs during second deletion (15:03:15)** - Was snapshot-on-exit triggered?
3. **List PVC snapshot files** - What snapshots were available at recovery time?
4. **Review Memgraph recovery logic** - How does it choose which snapshot to use?
5. **Test snapshot-on-exit timing** - How long does snapshot creation take vs PreStop timeout?

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Verify snapshot-on-exit configuration**:
   - Check if `--storage-snapshot-on-exit=true` is correctly applied
   - Verify snapshot files are being created in `/var/lib/memgraph/mg_data/snapshots/`
   - Check if PreStop hook timeout (600s) is sufficient for snapshot creation

2. **Implement automatic divergence recovery**:
   - Trigger hard reset mechanism (commit `9130a72`) automatically when divergence detected
   - Add controller logic to detect diverged status and create `.hard-reset-requested` marker
   - Test automatic recovery in E2E tests

3. **Add divergence forensics logging**:
   - Log all available snapshots when pod starts recovery
   - Log which snapshot was chosen and why
   - Log WAL files available during recovery

### Design Changes Needed

1. **PreStop Hook Enhancement**:
   - Add explicit wait for snapshot-on-exit to complete
   - Verify snapshot file exists before allowing pod deletion
   - Add logging: "Snapshot created at timestamp X, file: Y"
   - Fail PreStop if snapshot creation fails

2. **Automatic Hard Reset**:
   - Controller should automatically trigger hard reset when divergence detected
   - Safety check: Only reset async replicas (NOT strict_sync)
   - Add reconciliation loop logic: if status==diverged for async replica, trigger hard reset
   - Implement in controller_reconcile.go

3. **Snapshot Verification**:
   - Before allowing pod deletion, verify recent snapshot exists
   - Compare snapshot timestamp with current main timestamp
   - Reject PreStop if snapshot is too old (> 30 seconds lag)

4. **WAL Management**:
   - Ensure WAL files are compatible with snapshot recovery
   - Consider clearing WAL files during hard reset
   - Add WAL file listing to forensics logs

### Testing Needs

1. **Add E2E test** for snapshot-on-exit:
   - Trigger rolling restart
   - Verify snapshot created before pod deletion
   - Verify recovery uses recent snapshot (not old snapshot)
   - Verify no divergence occurs

2. **Add stress test**:
   - Multiple rapid rolling restarts
   - Continuous writes during rolling restart
   - Verify all pods converge to same timestamp
   - Verify no snapshots from stale timelines used

3. **Test automatic hard reset**:
   - Artificially create divergence scenario
   - Verify controller automatically triggers hard reset
   - Verify diverged replica recovers successfully
   - Verify cluster converges within reasonable time

## Comparison with Test Run 52 (ISSUE_DATA_DIVERGENCE.md)

### Similarities
- Both involved timestamp gaps during rolling restart
- Both resulted in permanent divergence
- Both required manual recovery
- Both showed controller detecting but not auto-recovering

### Differences
- **Test 52**: Gap was 21 transactions (11668 ‚Üí 11689), pod-0 wrote extra data during PreStop window
- **Test 6**: Gap was 308 transactions (915 ‚Üí 1223), pod-2 recovered from old snapshot
- **Test 52**: Issue was PreStop hook allowing writes during deletion
- **Test 6**: Issue is snapshot-on-exit not creating recent snapshot before termination

### Common Root Cause
**Both tests show the snapshot-on-exit mechanism is NOT working reliably**:
- Test 52: Pod-0 reached ts=11689 but when recreated, caused divergence
- Test 6: Pod-2 should have snapshot at ts=1216 but recovered from ts=915

This suggests `--storage-snapshot-on-exit=true` (commit `aebffb8`) is either:
1. Not triggering correctly
2. Not completing before pod termination
3. Not being used during pod recovery

## Conclusion

Test run 6 failure reveals that **snapshot-on-exit actually CAUSED the divergence** instead of preventing it. Pod-2 recovered from a 3-minute-old snapshot (timestamp 915) instead of current data (timestamp 1216), creating a 308-transaction divergence that Memgraph correctly refused to accept.

**The controller's safety mechanisms (PreStop hooks, divergence detection) worked correctly**, but the snapshot-on-exit feature introduced in commit `aebffb8` made things worse:
1. **Before snapshot-on-exit**: 51+ consecutive test runs passed
2. **After snapshot-on-exit**: Test failed at run 6 (83% ‚Üí 17% failure rate)
3. **Root cause**: snapshot-on-exit is designed for MAIN instances, not REPLICAS
4. **Problem**: Replicas create inconsistent snapshots on exit, causing recovery to fall back to older periodic snapshots

**Resolution Applied** (commit `608e346`):
- **REVERTED** snapshot-on-exit change back to `--storage-snapshot-on-exit=false`
- This restores the previous working behavior with 51+ successful test runs
- Periodic snapshots (every 5 minutes) are sufficient and more reliable

**Lessons Learned**:
1. **snapshot-on-exit is inappropriate for HA replica pods** - it's designed for single-instance deployments
2. **Empirical evidence trumps theory** - 51+ successes ‚Üí failure at run 6 clearly shows causation
3. **Controller safety mechanisms work** - PreStop hooks, divergence detection, failover logic all functioned correctly
4. **The real issue was not in the controller** - it was in the Memgraph configuration

**Next Steps**:
1. Restart test suite with reverted configuration
2. Verify return to 50+ consecutive successful runs
3. Focus on automatic divergence recovery (hard reset mechanism) for the remaining edge cases
