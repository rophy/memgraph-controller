# Implementation Plan: Memgraph Controller â†’ Gateway Enhancement

## Overview
Transform the existing memgraph-controller into a combined gateway-controller that provides transparent TCP proxying to the current master with automatic failover.

## Stage 1: Core Gateway Infrastructure
**Goal**: Add basic TCP proxy server to existing controller
**Success Criteria**: Gateway accepts connections and forwards to current master
**Tests**: Connection establishment, basic message forwarding
**Status**: Complete

### Tasks:
1. Add gateway server struct and configuration
2. Implement TCP listener on Bolt port (7687)
3. Create connection tracking and proxy session management
4. Add graceful shutdown for gateway server
5. Integrate gateway startup/shutdown with controller lifecycle

## Stage 2: TCP Proxy Implementation
**Goal**: Implement transparent TCP proxy to current master
**Success Criteria**: Clients can connect and execute queries through gateway
**Tests**: Connection forwarding, query execution, failover handling
**Status**: Complete

### Tasks:
1. Implement bidirectional TCP proxy using io.Copy
2. Connect to current master pod based on controller state
3. Handle connection errors and cleanup
4. Add basic connection health monitoring

## Stage 3: Failover Integration
**Goal**: Connect gateway to controller's master change detection
**Success Criteria**: Gateway disconnects all connections on master change, clients reconnect to new master
**Tests**: Master failover scenarios, connection termination
**Status**: Complete

### Tasks:
1. Integrate gateway with controller's cluster state
2. Implement connection termination on master change
3. Update master endpoint for new connections
4. Handle failover edge cases (master unavailable, split-brain)
5. Add failover metrics and logging

## Stage 4: Enhanced Connection Management
**Goal**: Optimize connection handling and add observability
**Success Criteria**: Efficient connection handling, comprehensive metrics
**Tests**: Connection limits, performance benchmarks, monitoring
**Status**: Not Started

### Tasks:
1. Add connection metrics (active, total, errors, failovers)
2. Implement configurable connection limits and timeouts
3. Add health checks for master connectivity
4. Optimize memory usage for connection tracking
5. Add connection duration and bandwidth metrics

## Stage 5: Production Readiness
**Goal**: Add security, monitoring, and operational features
**Success Criteria**: Production-ready deployment with full observability
**Tests**: Security validation, performance testing, operational scenarios
**Status**: Not Started

### Tasks:
1. Add TLS support for client connections
2. Implement rate limiting and connection throttling
3. Add comprehensive logging and tracing
4. Create deployment manifests with service configuration
5. Add graceful restart and zero-downtime deployment support

## Implementation Guidelines

### Architecture Principles:
- Maintain existing controller functionality unchanged
- Gateway runs as embedded server within controller process
- Share cluster state between controller and gateway components
- Prioritize connection stability over feature complexity

### Error Handling:
- Fail fast for configuration errors
- Graceful degradation for backend connection issues
- Clear error messages with recovery guidance
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Performance Targets:
- < 1ms additional latency for proxied requests
- < 100ms connection termination time on failover
- Support 1000+ concurrent connections
- Minimal memory overhead per connection

### Testing Strategy:
- Unit tests for core gateway components
- Integration tests with real Memgraph instances
- Failover scenario testing
- Performance and load testing

## Configuration Changes

### New Environment Variables:
- `GATEWAY_ENABLED=true` - Enable gateway functionality
- `GATEWAY_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:7687` - Gateway listening address
- `GATEWAY_MAX_CONNECTIONS=1000` - Maximum concurrent connections
- `GATEWAY_TIMEOUT=30s` - Backend connection timeout

### Kubernetes Service Updates:
- Expose port 7687 for Bolt protocol traffic
- Add gateway-specific health checks
- Update service annotations for load balancing
