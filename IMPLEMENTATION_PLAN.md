# Implementation Plan: Memgraph Controller â†’ Gateway Enhancement

## Overview
Transform the existing memgraph-controller into a combined gateway-controller that provides transparent Bolt protocol proxying with zero-downtime failover.

## Stage 1: Core Gateway Infrastructure
**Goal**: Add basic TCP proxy server to existing controller
**Success Criteria**: Gateway accepts connections and forwards to current master
**Tests**: Connection establishment, basic message forwarding
**Status**: Not Started

### Tasks:
1. Add gateway server struct and configuration
2. Implement TCP listener on Bolt port (7687)
3. Create connection tracking and proxy session management
4. Add graceful shutdown for gateway server
5. Integrate gateway startup/shutdown with controller lifecycle

## Stage 2: Bolt Protocol Integration
**Goal**: Implement Bolt handshake preservation and transparent proxying
**Success Criteria**: Clients can authenticate and execute queries through gateway
**Tests**: Handshake forwarding, authentication, query execution
**Status**: Not Started

### Tasks:
1. Implement Bolt handshake detection and forwarding
2. Add bidirectional message proxying with proper buffering
3. Handle connection errors and cleanup
4. Preserve client authentication state during proxying
5. Add connection health monitoring

## Stage 3: Failover Integration
**Goal**: Connect gateway to controller's master change detection
**Success Criteria**: Gateway automatically switches to new master during failover
**Tests**: Master failover scenarios, connection draining
**Status**: Not Started

### Tasks:
1. Integrate gateway with controller's cluster state
2. Implement connection draining on master change
3. Add new master connection establishment
4. Handle failover edge cases (master unavailable, split-brain)
5. Add failover metrics and logging

## Stage 4: Enhanced Connection Management
**Goal**: Optimize connection handling and add observability
**Success Criteria**: Efficient connection pooling, comprehensive metrics
**Tests**: Connection reuse, performance benchmarks, monitoring
**Status**: Not Started

### Tasks:
1. Implement connection pooling to backend masters
2. Add connection metrics (active, total, errors)
3. Implement configurable connection limits and timeouts
4. Add health checks for backend connections
5. Optimize memory usage for connection tracking

## Stage 5: Production Readiness
**Goal**: Add security, monitoring, and operational features
**Success Criteria**: Production-ready deployment with full observability
**Tests**: Security validation, performance testing, operational scenarios
**Status**: Not Started

### Tasks:
1. Add TLS support for client connections
2. Implement rate limiting and connection throttling
3. Add comprehensive logging and tracing
4. Create deployment manifests with service configuration
5. Add graceful restart and zero-downtime deployment support

## Implementation Guidelines

### Architecture Principles:
- Maintain existing controller functionality unchanged
- Gateway runs as embedded server within controller process
- Share cluster state between controller and gateway components
- Prioritize connection stability over feature complexity

### Error Handling:
- Fail fast for configuration errors
- Graceful degradation for backend connection issues
- Clear error messages with recovery guidance
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Performance Targets:
- < 1ms additional latency for proxied requests
- < 500ms failover time from master change detection
- Support 1000+ concurrent connections
- Minimal memory overhead per connection

### Testing Strategy:
- Unit tests for core gateway components
- Integration tests with real Memgraph instances
- Failover scenario testing
- Performance and load testing

## Configuration Changes

### New Environment Variables:
- `GATEWAY_ENABLED=true` - Enable gateway functionality
- `GATEWAY_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:7687` - Gateway listening address
- `GATEWAY_MAX_CONNECTIONS=1000` - Maximum concurrent connections
- `GATEWAY_TIMEOUT=30s` - Backend connection timeout

### Kubernetes Service Updates:
- Expose port 7687 for Bolt protocol traffic
- Add gateway-specific health checks
- Update service annotations for load balancing
